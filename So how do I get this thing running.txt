So how do you get this thing running...

First of all, you need to have Java Developers Kit (SDK) installed to be able to 
compile the source.

Fast and simple:
Simply use the batch/shell scripts to compile and run the app.

Ant:
You can use ant to build and run the movie manager. The available commands are 
displayed when running ant with no argument.

Eclipse:
Start a new project and choose the 'Create project from existing source'.
Browse your way to the root directory of where you unpacked these files 
(where the .project and .classpath files are located) and select.
Apply a name to the project and click next.
Eclipse should do some searching, and when it's done click finish and you should 
be good to go.
