So how do you get this thing running...

You need to have Java Developers Kit (SDK) installed to be able to 
compile the source.

To build and run from command line, you need to install ant. The available
commands are displayed when running ant with no argument.

Eclipse:
Start a new project and choose the 'Create project from existing source'.
Browse your way to the root directory of where you unpacked these files 
(where the .project and .classpath files are located) and select.
Apply a name to the project and click next.
Eclipse should do some searching, and when it's done click finish and you should 
be good to go.
